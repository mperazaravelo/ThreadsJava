This is a project that I created during class COP3330 (Object Oriented Programming) at Valencia College to apply basic knowledge about threads in Java.
The objective of this program is to demonstrate the use of threads and concurrency, by creating two
threads which will run independently and go into a battle, only one of them being the winner.
The user will not need to input any values, and everything will be printed out in the screen according to
the values provided.
First, each contestant will rest for a certain amount of time. Then, they will perform an action (in this
case eating an amount of hot dogs). The program will evaluate if the contestant has won (if they have eaten
200 hot dogs or more). If there is a winner, there will be a message printed out, and if not, the contestants
will drink water, and the iteration will begin again.
